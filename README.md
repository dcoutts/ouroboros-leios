This repository is for documentatin and tools related to the design
and prototyping of Ouroboros Leios.

Currently there is:
* `report`: the LaTeX source for the design report
* `CIP`: the initial version of the Leios CIP
* `simulation`: simulation and visualisation code for investigating Leios-like network traffic patterns.

See also the [pull request](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/379) for the Leios CIP.
