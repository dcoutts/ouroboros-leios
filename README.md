This repository is for documentation and tools related to the design and prototyping of Ouroboros Leios.

# Content

The [Leios CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/379) initially proposed in November 2022, yielded the following content:

* `report`: the LaTeX source for the design report
* `CIP`: the initial version of the Leios CIP
* `simulation`: simulation and visualisation code for investigating Leios-like network traffic patterns.

The [Logbook](Logbook.md) contains a detailed account of problems,  successes, failures, ideas, references and is intended as a tool to  help the team members stay in sync.
