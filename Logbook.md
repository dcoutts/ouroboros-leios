* Invited team to the existing repository containing Duncan's initial simulation work and technical report for CIP publication
* Started logbook :)

### Kick-off meeting

* Renate from Consensus team will be the main person working full time on this in a  "Prototype engineer" role
* Arnaud will be helping her, looking for synergies with the work we do in Peras
* Giorgios will be research liaison
* We have scheduled a weekly working session every Thursday at 2pm CET, the first occurence of which happened today.
* Next step will be to build a model of Leios in code in order to better understand how the protocol works in a broad brush way
* Wealso want to look at previous work done by Duncan  both in the design document and the network simulation he built
* Today we also touched lightly on the topic of modelling Leios using Delta-Q: It seems the Leios pipeline described in the paper lends itself nicely to such kind of performance modelling
